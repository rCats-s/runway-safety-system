## Layout
- `client` - the JavaFX front-end
- `server` - the socket server backend
- `shared` - code that is used by both

## How to compile
Intellij -> Maven Sidebar
Under shared -> Lifecycle -> Install
Under client -> Lifecycle -> Package
Under server -> Lifecycle -> Package

## How to run final release
Run the server.jar file and then run the client.jar file. As the client requests connection to the server upon intialisation.
